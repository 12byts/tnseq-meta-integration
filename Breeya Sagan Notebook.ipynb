    "- __make_prot_tables.py__ - A python script that converts the GFF files from Prokka into prot_table files for TRANSIT. \n",
    "- __findTASites.py__ - For each fasta file in the directory, makes a list of all of the TA sites available.\n",
    "- __make_wig.py__ - Makes a wig file recognized by the TRANSIT software from a tabular file and a list of TA sites created using findTASites.py.\n",
    "- __labelWIGs.py__ - Using the master tag list, changes the gene names in the prot_table files into Roary tags that can be compared across all strains. Then it uses these new prot_tables to annotate the genes in the wig files. For this script to work, the prot_tables have to be named just with the name of the strain and the wig filename has to also include the strain. This script works on all prot_tables and wigs in the directory. The annotated WIGs are saved as csv files.  \n",
    "- __MasterTagList.csv__ - A list of gene names and locations from different strains matched up using Roary (3). NCBI tags are also included, matched to the Prokka genes based on location. \n",
    "- __permutation.py__ - Adds together the reads from all annotated wig files for a strain (file name must start with Roary_*Strain* and must be a csv) and then for each pair of strains, performs a permutation test.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "1. Create Prot_Tables (runs on all GFFs in directory) `python make_prot_tables.py`\n",
    "2. Create TA site files (runs on all fastas in directory) `python findTASites.py`\n",
    "3. Create wig files (runs on a single fasta-tabular file pair) `python make_wig.py <XXX_TASites.txt> <XXX.tabular>`\n",
    "4. Run TRANSIT (see <https://pythonhosted.org/tnseq-transit/index.html> for more information).\n",
    "5. Make sure names are compatible with labelWIGs.py and permutation.py (see file descriptions above). \n",
    "6. Rename the genes in the Prot_Tables based on the Roary tags. `python labelWIGs.py` \n",
    "7. Perform the permutation test. By comparing the outputs of this script to the TRANSIT outputs, you can determine which differences in gene essentiality identified by TRANSIT are significant.  `python permutation.py`\n",
